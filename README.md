# Java-Data-Structures
This is a Java program that allows users to interact with the various methods of data structures and manage them. Users can manage their data utilizing int numbers in 5 methods, which are LinkedLists, Stack, Queues, MinHeap and Binary Search Tree (BST). Most of these methods utilize functions that are almost provided across the 5 methods, which are to insert and delete numbers, as well as taking a look at them by viewing them. This project was done with Microsoft Visual Studio Code and class lecture materials from the Data Structure class in the IT program at York University. The biggest challenge in creating this program was not relying on the Java Collections Framework to create the various data structures. This required me to create the methods from scratch, such as the add, delete and display features for LinkedLists. I plan on exploring the other Data Structure methods that are available and adding them to the Java program.

How to use the project:
Ensure that all the program files are downloaded and in the same folder of the program (Folder name is 2620DataStructures). The program folder should have dataProject.java (The main program file to access the data structures), and the 5 data structure method files (LinkedLists, Stack, Queue, MinHeap and Binary Search Tree (BST)). To run the program, go to dataProject.java and run the file.
